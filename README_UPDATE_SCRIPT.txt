To have the auto updater work, you need to have git installed.

On windows, it needs to be linked to command prompt. Then just run the file from the explorer.

To execute it on mac, you need to change int this directory with terminal then run "bash MacGitUpdater.sh"
Might as well just use terminal to use git anyways . . .
